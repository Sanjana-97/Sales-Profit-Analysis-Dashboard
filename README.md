# Superstore Sales & Profit Dashboards with Story

This repository contains Tableau visualizations built using the Superstore dataset. It includes dashboards for both **Sales** and **Profit**, as well as a **Story** that presents a comprehensive analysis of the business's performance across regions and categories.

## Key Components:

- **Sales Dashboard**: Visualizes total sales by region, category, and over time.
- **Profit Dashboard**: Displays profit distribution across regions and product categories.
- **Story**: A Tableau story that ties together the insights from the sales and profit dashboards, providing a complete view of the Superstore's performance.

## Files:

- `SuoerStore_Summary.twbx`: Tableau workbook containing the sales and profit dashboards, along with the story.
- `OrdersV2.xlsx`: Dataset used for the analysis.
